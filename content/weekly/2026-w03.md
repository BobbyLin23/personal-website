## Work Summary

This week was spent diving deep into Tailwind CSS v4's new engine and contributing to open source projects.

### Key Accomplishments

- Completed the **Tailwind CSS v4 migration** proof-of-concept for our design system
- Contributed a bug fix to the Vue Router repository
- Attended the local Vue.js meetup and gave a lightning talk on composables
- Set up automated testing pipeline for the component library

### Challenges

The biggest challenge was understanding the new `@theme` directive in Tailwind CSS v4. The migration from `tailwind.config.js` to CSS-based configuration required rethinking our design token strategy.

## Learning Notes

- Deep dive into **Tailwind CSS v4** Oxide engine — significantly faster builds
- Learned about **CSS Anchor Positioning** — a game-changer for popovers and tooltips
- Read "Refactoring UI" chapters 1-3
- Explored the new **Bun Shell** for scripting

2. Write a blog post about the Vue meetup experience
3. Review team's RFC on the new API design
4. Set up Playwright tests for critical user flows
