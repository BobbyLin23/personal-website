## Work Summary

A productive week focused on Vue 3 Composition API best practices and personal website redesign.

### Key Accomplishments

- Published a comprehensive blog post on **Vue 3 Composition API patterns**
- Redesigned the personal website layout with a cleaner, more minimal aesthetic
- Merged 4 PRs including a major refactor of the authentication module
- Created reusable composables for data fetching with error handling

### Challenges

Implementing proper TypeScript support for generic composables was tricky. The `defineProps` with complex generic types required some creative workarounds using `defineComponent` generics.

```typescript
// Generic composable pattern
function useCollection<T extends Record<string, any>>(
  collection: string,
  options?: { transform?: (item: T) => T }
) {
  const data = ref<T[]>([])
  // ...implementation
  return { data, pending, error }
}
```

## Learning Notes

- Mastered **Vue 3 generic components** with `<script setup>` and `defineProps`
- Explored **Nuxt Layers** for sharing code between projects
- Read "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" chapters 3-4
- Learned about **Web Components** interop with Vue
