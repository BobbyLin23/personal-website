## Work Summary

This week marked the launch of the weekly journal initiative and a deep focus on Nuxt 4 features.

### Key Accomplishments

- Published the blog post **"Building a Modern Personal Website with Nuxt 4"**
- Started the weekly journal initiative — you're reading the result!
- Fixed critical CI/CD pipeline issues that were causing flaky deployments
- Implemented hybrid rendering with route rules for optimal performance
- Merged 5 PRs across 3 repositories

### Challenges

The CI/CD pipeline had intermittent failures due to race conditions in the test suite. After investigation, it turned out to be related to shared state between test files. The fix involved proper test isolation and using `vi.restoreAllMocks()` in `afterEach` hooks.

## Learning Notes

- Deep dive into **Nuxt 4 hybrid rendering** — route rules for SSR/SSG/SPA per-page
- Explored **Nitro server routes** for building API endpoints
- Read "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" chapters 5-7
- Watched Evan You's talk on **Vue 3.5 improvements**
- Learned about **Edge rendering** with Cloudflare Workers
