## Work Summary

This week was primarily focused on exploring Nuxt 4 migration strategies and building internal tooling for the team.

### Key Accomplishments

- Completed the **Nuxt 4 migration guide** for our team's main project
- Built a CLI prototype for scaffolding new project modules
- Reviewed and merged 3 team pull requests
- Fixed a critical SSR hydration mismatch bug in production

### Challenges

The biggest challenge this week was dealing with the `@nuxt/content` v3 migration. The new collection-based API required significant refactoring of our content queries. After some investigation, I found that the [migration guide](https://content.nuxt.com) was missing some edge cases around dynamic content paths.

## Learning Notes

- Explored **Tailwind CSS v4** new engine — lightning-fast builds with the Oxide engine
- Learned about **Vue Vapor mode** compiler optimizations
- Read "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" chapters 5-7
- Watched a great talk on [Web Performance Patterns](https://web.dev) by Addy Osmani

## Interesting Finds
