As 2024 comes to a close, it's time to reflect on what's been an incredible year of growth and learning.

## Highlights

### Open Source Contributions

This year I contributed to several open source projects:

- **Vue ecosystem**: Bug fixes and documentation improvements
- **Nuxt modules**: Created two community modules
- **Tailwind plugins**: Published a custom plugin

### Projects Built

- Personal website (you're reading it!)
- A Vue component library
- Several client projects

## Lessons Learned

1. **Consistency beats intensity**: Small daily improvements compound
2. **Community matters**: Engaging with the dev community accelerated my growth
3. **Writing clarifies thinking**: Blogging helped me understand topics deeper

## By the Numbers

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Blog posts written | 15 |
| GitHub contributions | 500+ |
| Books read | 12 |
| Conferences attended | 3 |

## Looking Ahead to 2025

Goals for the new year:

- Dive deeper into **server-side rendering**
- Learn **Rust** for WebAssembly
- Contribute more to **Vue core**
- Start a **YouTube channel**
