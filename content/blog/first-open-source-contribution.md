Contributing to open source felt intimidating at first. Here's how I overcame the fear and made my first contribution.

## Finding the Right Project

I started by looking for:

- Projects I actively used (Vue, Nuxt, VueUse)
- Issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
- Documentation improvements (a great starting point!)

## The Contribution

My first contribution was a documentation fix for VueUse. It was small — fixing a typo and improving a code example — but it taught me the entire workflow:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch
3. Make changes
4. Write a clear commit message
5. Open a pull request
6. Respond to code review

## Lessons Learned

### Be Patient

Maintainers are busy. Don't expect immediate reviews.

### Read the Contributing Guide

Every project has different conventions. Always read `CONTRIBUTING.md` first.

### Start Small

- Fix typos
- Improve documentation
- Add tests
- Fix small bugs

### Communicate Clearly

Write descriptive PR titles and explain your changes:

```markdown
## What does this PR do?

Fixes the incorrect code example in the `useLocalStorage` documentation.

## Why?

The current example uses the old API that was deprecated in v10.
```

## Conclusion

Open source contribution is one of the best ways to grow as a developer. Don't be afraid to start small — every contribution matters!
